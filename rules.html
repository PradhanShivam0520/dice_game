            <h3>Game Rules üìÉ</h3>
            <p>On a turn,a player rolls the die repeatedly, adding up the numbers rolled on the die.</p>
            <p>
                However, if a player rolls a 1, the player's turn is over and any points they have accumulated
                during
                this turn are forfeited.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rolling a 1 doesn't wipe out yur entire socore from previous turns, just the total earned during
                that
                particular roll.
            </p>
            <p>A player can also choose to hold (stop rolling the die) if they do not want to take a chance of
                rolling a
                1 and losing all of their points from this turn. If the player chooses to hold, all of the points
                rolled
                during that turn are added to his or her score.</p>
            <p>
                A player win by being the first player to reach the <span class="target-score" style="display: inline;">
                    0 </span>or more points
                as
                setted.
